# PaperSearch

## Quick Start
Before running the search, you MUST download the .npz conference files from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Hw-RMskp-ydyIZva_EkV8IKbAKFB3ayt?usp=sharing). After downloading, put the files in a folder named "Conferences" within the same directory as the PaperSearch project. (Note that if you download more than one .npz file at once, you will need to unzip the compressed folder).
